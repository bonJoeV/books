  <h3>ðŸ“Œ Teamwork in Action:<br>Breaking Silos to Elevate Customer Success</h3>
  <p>
    One of the worldâ€™s leading cloud providers made a strategic shift: they launched weekly cross-functional meetings dedicated entirely to customer success. These meetings brought together teams from sales, support, engineering, and customer successâ€”ensuring that everyone had visibility into customer challenges, goals, and progress. </p>
  <p>
    By aligning efforts and sharing insights in real time, the teams were able to respond faster, resolve issues more effectively, and proactively support customers before problems escalated. </p>
  <p>
    The impact was clear and measurable: within just a few months, customer satisfaction scores climbed significantly, and internal collaboration reached new heights. It was a powerful reminder that when teams rally together around the customer, everyone wins. </p>
